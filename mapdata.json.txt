In the late 1990s his images began appearing on building facades in downtown Manhattan, complimenting the constant stir of bodies and the perpetual motion of contemporary urban life in the fast-paced city.","aboutThisText":null,"creationDate":null,"latitude":"40.72917800","longitude":"-74.03990700","additionalLink1":"www.wkinteract.com","additionalLink2":"https://streetartnews.net/2015/11/race-new-piece-by-wk-interact-in-jersey.html","additionalLink3":null,"recordCreated":"2016-09-19 15:44:44","recordModified":"2017-05-20 17:48:39"},{"id":"74","active":"1","derelict":"0","popularity":"114","freshWhenAdded":"0","tags":"animals, jcmap","muralTitle":"JC Giraffe","artistName":"Catherine Hart","imageResourceID":"M074","locationText":"114 Christopher Columbus Dr.\nJersey City, NJ 07302","aboutArtistText":"Catherine Hart is a drawer, painter, and mural artist/collaborator.

His work transcended communities, helping to create a new massive appeal for a new street culture in Chile. In 2004, Nelson moved to New York, seeking to grow more comprehensively as a creator and adult. Due to the lack of access to paint public walls in New York, his work started to move slowly into the studio and it has broadened into an experimental and investigative collection, developing his own way to paint.

Combining the elements of graphic design, tribal art, graffiti, Cubism, skateboard culture, 90's and 80's music, flamenco, social situations, Mediterranean life, Surrealism, nature, and kaleidoscope among others, Sanchez creates shapesgraffiti murals that explode with powerful colors and surrealistic magic.","aboutThisText":null,"creationDate":"2016-01-01","latitude":"40.73142100","longitude":"-74.04730600","additionalLink1":"http://www.iamrubensanchez.com/","additionalLink2":"http://www.widewalls.ch/artist/ruben-sanchez/","additionalLink3":null,"recordCreated":"2017-03-13 22:45:21","recordModified":"2017-09-21 18:57:25"},{"id":"143","active":"1","derelict":"0","popularity":"99","freshWhenAdded":"0","tags":"graffiti, cartoon, green villain","muralTitle":"GVM019","artistName":"Jaek El Diablo","imageResourceID":"M143","locationText":"575 Manila Ave.\nJersey City, NJ 07310","aboutArtistText":"Jaek El Diablo, graffiti artist and graphics designer illustrator, appropriates the codes playing maliciously with the world of communication.\n\nHis inspiration comes from graphics and typographies originally from what we could have qualified in the past such as counter-culture.

His paintings, and huge monumentally scaled site-specific murals, are phenomenal combinations of realist painting technique and graphic punctuation. Inspired by gritty urban graffiti as a young artist growing up in Washington, DC, Bullough harnessed its energy in his work, and perfected a realistic oil painting technique from his study of the Old Masters. Combining the momentum of the one and the technical precision of the other, his work is about staging compelling contrasts and juxtapositions. Working in everything from oil, spray paint and ink on canvas, Bullough's paintings strike a balance between realistic figurations and stylized interruption. Disjointing the realistic elements with graphic areas and fractured or striated planes, Bullough intends to challenge the viewer's perception.\n\nAbout Varenka Ruiz\nThe real voyage of discovery is not in searching for the new, but in looking with new eyes","aboutThisText":"\"This is the mural I did in collaboration with James Bullough.

By 1980, he began transitioning from train yards to galleries, he curated the ground-breaking \"Graffiti Art Success for America\" at Fashion MODA, launching the graffiti movement that has remained very active through today.

He is one of the few artists from that period to make the successful transition from the subways to the studio. His first group show was the \"Beyond Words\" show held at the Mudd club in New York in 1981. Showing alongside artists such as Jean Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, Daze sold his first work, an impromptu collaboration with Basquiat, from this show.

While Iurato's murals have adorned neighborhoods along the east coast United States for years, he's more recently become noted for the unique placement and photography of miniature painted wood cutouts in public spaces.

After the Second Great Migration, Newark became a predominantly black city and an intellectual platform of radical black politics after WWII. In addition to Newark�s preeminent position as a transportation hub, the Meadowlands that define the surrounding environment is a welcoming respite for a diverse range of migratory birds that commute between the hemispheres according to the seasonal changes. For this reason, the mural features migratory birds, two airplanes, Henry the Navigator and a caravel in his fleet. It also portrays Garcia II Nkanga a Lukeni a Nzenze a Ntumba, who is also known as Garcia Alfonso for short. Alfonso ruled the Kingdom of Kongo from January 23, 1641, to 1661; he is sometimes considered Kongo�s greatest king for his religious piety and his near expulsion of the Portuguese from Angola.

He began his career with no formal studies in art, and his first inspiration came from portraits of the common man and woman that make up the human scenery of the Peruvian cities. His style started with the exercise of realism but then developed to emphasize the interconnectivity between the individual and the community in the social psyche.

This contributed to finding their way on muralism, risking new formats, and reinterpreting pre-Hispanic iconography in his style.\n\nCurrently, Decertor feeds on the social context and the architectural sites that he chooses to do his work, always seeking for an active confrontation of the mural with the viewers. He believes that street painting is an effective tool to bring social and global issues to the fore. He strives to perform his work by decentralizing and democratizing the walls, which transforms them and elicits their humanity.

Instinct, speed, color, emotional dirtying, passionate streaks, hugs of the brushstrokes. Everything matches with gesture which gets always immediate, hot, and sudden. The vision of this young artist from Pescara is pervaded by a variety of sensations that stretch the brain with a pincer, give gooseflesh with a shake, let swell with a cold shower and reflect the idea of ??infinite emerging from the encounter with the other and his face. Raul paints with a primitive speed since his painting is a way to materialize an emotion. So his faces belong to the people he meets in his travels, the streaks are the streets he walks, the marker strokes are thoughts taking a place without support. Then, that visceral connection with music, that's all, wraps him, it's everywhere. Born in Pescara (1980) Raul lives and works between USA and Europe. He travels the world, studying different cultures at the constant research of symbolic languages, energy and meanings, which he transmits to his public through his art. He begins to develop his passion for art, painting on any material he finds in his innumerable travel. From walls to paper, from glass to plastic, from newspaper to lined notebook used in schools, anything is possible for Raul if the surface permits it. His exhibits are numerous in Italy and abroad.","aboutThisText":null,"creationDate":"2017-01-01","latitude":"40.73146400","longitude":"-74.04749100","additionalLink1":"http://www.raul33.com/","additionalLink2":null,"additionalLink3":null,"recordCreated":"2017-09-21 03:40:44","recordModified":"2017-09-21 18:57:38"},{"id":"392","active":"1","derelict":"0","popularity":"99","freshWhenAdded":"0","tags":"mana, large scale","muralTitle":"Untitled","artistName":"Kofie","imageResourceID":"M390","locationText":"581 Monmouth St. Jersey City, NJ 07302","aboutArtistText":"American, b. 1973, Los Angeles, California, based in Los Angeles, California\n\nA self-taught artist whose practice is rooted in graffiti, Augustine Kofie embraces an aesthetic of pure abstraction that features simple geometries of squares, circles, and lines. Kofie finds harmony in opposites, creating earth-toned compositions reminiscent of Italian Futurism with intensely detailed and complex, layered lines. The artist seeks to challenge preconceived notions about graffiti's status as an art form, and he culls inspiration from modern architecture, typography, 1960s iconography, and street culture. The drafting and sketching associated with graffiti and illustration provided Kofie with a technical foundation and appreciation for the graphic elements of writing.\n\n","aboutThisText":"Mana Urban Arts Project and Jonathan Levine Gallery highlighted Los Angeles-based artist Augustine Kofie's addition to the Ice House, the latest from an ongoing collaboration. Kofie harmonizes differing shapes and angles in his work by setting futuristic compositions against vintage earth-toned palettes and collaged graphics, creating organically complex formations through meticulously structured line work and layering.\n\nKofie describes his process, both in collage and in painting, as one of building, like an architect making a model in two dimensions for a structure that will never be built. The found materials are the first building blocks of this process, and the painting and drawing that follows brings them into new purpose and new life. \"I'm not building brand new systems, I'm building systems that have existed and have been forgotten,\" he says.","creationDate":"2015-01-01","latitude":"40.73100400","longitude":"-74.04807000","additionalLink1":"http://keepdrafting.com/","additionalLink2":null,"additionalLink3":null,"recordCreated":"2017-09-21 18:48:47","recordModified":"2017-09-21 19:19:14"},{"id":"393","active":"1","derelict":"0","popularity":"99","freshWhenAdded":"0","tags":"mana, wide","muralTitle":"Tribute to NACEO","artistName":"Rime","imageResourceID":"M391","locationText":"310 12th St\nJersey City, NJ 07310","aboutArtistText":"RIME has over twenty-five years of experience in graffiti and is recognized as an esteemed artist with adventurous style.

","aboutThisText":"I Just Want To Come Home declares a new mural in Bushwick on a Food Bazaar Supermarket, painted by a team of young men considering the complex relationship between police and young men of color. As proven by recently publicized deaths and the #BlackLivesMatter activist movement, police-civilian relations do not always come with the promise of youth coming home after an alteration. The artist team researched this topic through interviews with activists, Brooklyn council members and legislators, lifelong residents and newcomers to the Bushwick community, and police officers from the 90th Precinct. They read articles, watched videos, listened to podcasts, and discussed issues around police aggression, the war on drugs, mass incarceration, protests in Ferguson and Baltimore, the militarization of police in contemporary America, and discussed with police officers how they view this conversation. The mural utilizes the phrase I Just Want To Come Home as its rallying call to action, inspired by their interview with police from the 90th Precinct. The youth asked What do you think about when getting ready for work? to which one officer responded, I just want to come home at the end of the day. Resonating beyond its origin from the officers reply, this sentiment echoes a larger call from everyday civilians to prevent the recurrence of such cases as Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, and Kalief Browder, who spent three years on Rikers Island without being convicted of a crime before committing suicide. The mural brings together these various narratives on common ground to address the tense conflict. Within the words are faces of the artists and local community members, which bring a focus to Bushwick as an important site for reflection, debate, and activism.

The team also referenced Ms. Marvel and Priya Shakit comics to help build a graphic and imaginative narrative.

This marked the natural direction for Fanakapan to become immersed in, offering much scope for the chance to develop his focus on light and shadow in order to bring his works to life.","aboutThisText":null,"creationDate":"2017-01-01","latitude":"40.71713900","longitude":"-73.99451800","additionalLink1":null,"additionalLink2":null,"additionalLink3":null,"recordCreated":"2017-11-01 21:39:17","recordModified":"2017-11-25 02:15:50"},{"id":"462","active":"1","derelict":"0","popularity":"99","freshWhenAdded":"0","tags":null,"muralTitle":"Little Mystery Friends","artistName":"Key Detail & Yu Ba Ba","imageResourceID":"m456","locationText":"33 1st Avenue\nNew York, NY 10003","aboutArtistText":"About Key Detail:\nKey Detail is a Belarusian artist based in New York Murals, Illustration, Street Art, Graffiti \n\nAbout Yu Baba:\nBelarusian female mural artist YU-BABA currently lives and works in New York, USA. \n\nGermany, Italy, France, Austria, UK, Belgium, Greece, Poland, USA, India, Belarus are some of the countries where her work can be found.

He embraces the beauty of man while masterfully intertwining elements of raunchiness and vulgarity to depict his culture's abrasive nature. Naked people are regular amongst his murals, with their eyes and mouth often seen telling Ever Siempre's story, detailed components of his work that point out the message of his particular piece. Specifically, the individual's eyes or mouth are open wide, gestures that cause his audience to take note of what he is trying to convey through his art. Typically, detailed work and techniques accompany these beams of light that have become an integral part of Ever Siempre's masterpieces. What's interesting to note is that you rarely see the person's eyes; they are either closed or projecting beams of light out of them. This can be seen as the artist's means of cleverly obscuring our ability to look deep into the soul of the everyday person he is painting, since he clearly feels that we overlook them anyway.\n\nAbout Zio Zielgler:\nZio Ziegler is an American painter and sculptor born in 1988.
